msgid "PARKINSON’S DISEASE"
msgstr ""

msgid "We have performed preliminary studies on a key protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alpha-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein and its folding/misfolding (see figure on the right for misfolded aggregates) appears to be critically linked to PD. We have evaluated the application of various FAH methods to this problem. For now, PD stands still as a pilot project, with the bulk of our efforts going into Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Huntington’s Disease (HD)."
